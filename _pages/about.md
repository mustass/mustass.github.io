I am a PhD student at the **Technical University of Denmark (DTU)**, supervised by [SÃ¸ren Hauberg](http://people.compute.dtu.dk/sohau/). Prior to this, I completed a Master's degree in **Mathematical Modeling and Computing** at DTU and a Bachelor's degree in **Mathematics-Economics** at the University of Copenhagen (KU).

My research lies at the intersection of **mathematics and machine learning**, where I explore mathematically grounded concepts applied to modern AI methods. Specifically, I focus on **Generative Modeling**, with research interests spanning **identifiability**, **metric learning**, and **manifold learning** within this context.

Outside of academia, I have worked as a **Machine Learning Engineer**, training and deploying transformer-based models for personalized search and recommendation systems. I also have experience as a **Data Scientist** at a pension institute, applying machine learning techniques to real-world data problems.
